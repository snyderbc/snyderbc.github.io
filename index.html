    <p>For a more comprehensive look at Austin's best live music venues, check out <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/best-venues-live-music-austin">this Thrillist article</a>. This site does a great job of breaking out the different sections with a systematic style, and I like the way they highlight their links with a red underline (and a full highlight if you scroll over it). The site also uses photos well, and does a good job of weaving in callouts to related articles - again with a distinct format. They also have social media callouts, a nice header to easily browse other areas of the website, and they do a good job of citing their sources. My biggest complaint is that the site is riddled with ads - that and the callouts can be very distracting!</p>
